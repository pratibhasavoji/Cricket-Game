# Cricket-Game
This game was entirely developed on C++. And hence the low graphics xD

*Note: This code works only on Turbo C++ environment*
## Dependencies
Make sure Graphics.h is imported, that is the key library in the entire project.

A good ram is recommended to avoid buffering.

Just click Ctrl+F9 and it works like a charm:")
